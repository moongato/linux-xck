Subject: [PATCH] usb: xhci: Fix host controllers "dying" after suspend and
 resume

A recent cleanup went a bit too far and dropped clearing the cycle bit
of link TRBs, so it stays different from the rest of the ring half of
the time. Then a race occurs: if the xHC reaches such link TRB before
more commands are queued, the link's cycle bit uintentionally matches
the xHC's cycle so it follows the link and waits for further commands.
If more commands are queued before the xHC gets there, inc_enq() flips
the bit so the xHC later sees a mismatch and stops executing commands.

This function is called before suspend and 50% of times after resuming
the xHC is doomed to get stuck sooner or later. Then some Stop Endpoint
command fails to complete in 5 seconds and this shows up

xhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
xhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
xhci_hcd 0000:00:10.0: HC died; cleaning up

followed by loss of all USB decives on the affected bus. That's if you
are lucky, because if Set Deq gets stuck instead, the failure is silent.

Likely responsible for kernel bug 219824. I found this while searching
for possible causes of that regression and reproduced it locally before
hearing back from the reporter. To repro, simply wait for link cycle to
become set (debugfs), then suspend, resume and wait. To accelerate the
failure I used a script which repeatedly starts and stops a UVC camera.

Some HCs get fully reinitialized on resume and they are not affected.
